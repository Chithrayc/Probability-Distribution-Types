# Probability-Distribution-Types

📌 Probability Distribution 
A probability distribution describes how the values of a random variable are spread or distributed. Different types of distributions are used in statistics to model real-world patterns, predict outcomes, and perform data analysis.

Types

🔹 1. Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution represents the probability of achieving a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes — success or failure — and the probability of success remains constant.
> Example: Flipping a coin 10 times and counting heads.


🔹 2. Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution measures the probability of a given number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, when the events happen independently and at a constant average rate.
> Example: Number of customers arriving at a shop in one hour.


🔹 3. Normal Distribution
The normal (Gaussian) distribution is a continuous distribution shaped like a bell curve. Most values cluster around the mean, and probabilities decrease symmetrically as values move away from the mean.
> Example: Human height, test scores, product measurements.
